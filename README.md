- Pokemon name
- Type badges with color coding
- Remove button

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (3.10.7 or higher)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poke_builder.git
cd poke_builder
```

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

1. Generate JSON serialization code:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Running the App

#### On Android/iOS

flutter run
```

#### On Web

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

#### On specific device

```bash

## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models**: Pokemon data structures with JSON serialization
- **Services**: PokeAPI client and local persistence
- **Providers**: Riverpod state management
- **UI**: Screens, widgets, and dialogs

For detailed architecture information, see [Architecture Documentation](docs/design/architecture.md).

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter
- **State Management**: Riverpod
- **Navigation**: GoRouter
- **HTTP Client**: http package
- **Persistence**: path_provider
- **JSON Serialization**: json_serializable
- **API**: PokeAPI v2

├── models/                      # Data models

```

## Development

### Code Generation

After modifying model classes with `@JsonSerializable()`, run:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Or for continuous generation during development:

```bash
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Testing

Run tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

### Building for Production

#### Android APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

#### Android App Bundle

```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```
